### Virtual Cybersecurity Home Lab 

*(Ongoing Project)* To gain practical, hands-on experience beyond theoretical knowledge, I designed and built a virtualized cybersecurity home lab. This environment utilizes virtual machines running **Windows 11** and **BlackArch Linux**/**ParrotOs** VMware, creating a sandboxed space to safely simulate and analyze real-world cybersecurity scenarios. BlackArch also serves as my personal machine to complete tryhackme's challenges (instead of built-in VM's) and whole home lab serves as training ground for practicing network reconnaissance and executing various attack techniques.
